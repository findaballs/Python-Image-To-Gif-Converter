# Python Image to GIF Converter

A small Python program that converts images (png, jpg, etc.) into GIF files.

I made this because I wanted a quick and simple way to turn images into GIFs without using online tools.

## What it does
- Converts images to GIF
- Supports common formats like PNG and JPG
- Free and open source

## Requirements
- Python 3
- Pillow
- imageio

(Optional)
- pyinstaller (only if you want to build an executable)

## Install
```bash
pip install Pillow imageio
